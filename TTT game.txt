Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game that takes turn marking spaces on a 3 by 3 grid, 
and the objective of the game is to place three connecting marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
This project is part of my Java programming studies applying the knowledge I gained via online sources. Hoping
this boosts my chances of earning my first developer employment. Simple to use, the control will ask of you 
to type two digits (row/column) from 1 - 3 and this will in turn place an X or O is designated position. 
First to align three of the marks is the winner.
